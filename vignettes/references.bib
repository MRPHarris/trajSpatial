abstract = {AbstractThe Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT), developed by NOAA?s Air Resources Laboratory, is one of the most widely used models for atmospheric trajectory and dispersion calculations. We present the model?s historical evolution over the last 30 years from simple hand-drawn back trajectories to very sophisticated computations of transport, mixing, chemical transformation, and deposition of pollutants and hazardous materials. We highlight recent applications of the HYSPLIT modeling system, including the simulation of atmospheric tracer release experiments, radionuclides, smoke originated from wild fires, volcanic ash, mercury, and wind-blown dust.},

@article{Cui2021,
abstract = {Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to obtain backward trajectories and then conduct clustering analysis is a common method to analyze potential sources and transmission paths of atmospheric particulate pollutants. Taking Qingdao (N36 E120) as an example, the global data assimilation system (GDAS 1°) of days from 2015 to 2018 provided by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is used to process the backward 72 h trajectory data of 3 arrival heights (10 m, 100 m, 500 m) through the HYSPLIT model with a data interval of 6 h (UTC 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, and 18:00 per day). Three common clustering methods of trajectory data, i.e., K-means, Hierarchical clustering (Hier), and Self-organizing maps (SOM), are used to conduct clustering analysis of trajectory data, and the results are compared with those of the HYSPLIT model released by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the original trajectory data. The internal evaluation indexes of Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI), Silhouette Coefficient (SC), Calinski Harabasz Index (CH), and I index are used to quantitatively evaluate the three clustering algorithms. The results show that there is little information in the height data, and thus only two-dimensional plane data are used for clustering. From the results of clustering indexes, the clustering results of SOM and K-means are better than the Hier and HYSPLIT model. In addition, it is found that DBI and I index can help to select the number of clusters, of which DBI is preferred for cluster analysis.},

@article{Kassomenos2010,
abstract = {In this study, we used and compared three different statistical clustering methods: an hierarchical, a non-hierarchical (K-means) and an artificial neural network technique (self-organizing maps (SOM)). These classification methods were applied to a 4-year dataset of 5 days kinematic back trajectories of air masses arriving in Athens, Greece at 12.00 UTC, in three different heights, above the ground. The atmospheric back trajectories were simulated with the HYSPLIT Vesion 4.7 model of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The meteorological data used for the computation of trajectories were obtained from NOAA reanalysis database. A comparison of the three statistical clustering methods through statistical indices was attempted. It was found that all three statistical methods seem to depend to the arrival height of the trajectories, but the degree of dependence differs substantially. Hierarchical clustering showed the highest level of dependence for fast-moving trajectories to the arrival height, followed by SOM. K-means was found to be the least depended clustering technique on the arrival height. The air quality management applications of these results in relation to PM10 concentrations recorded in Athens, Greece, were also discussed. Differences of PM10 concentrations, during certain clusters, were found statistically different (at 95% confidence level) indicating that these clusters appear to be associated with long-range transportation of particulates. This study can improve the interpretation of modelled atmospheric trajectories, leading to a more reliable analysis of synoptic weather circulation patterns and their impacts on urban air quality. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Schubert2021,
abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids clustering. In Euclidean geometry the mean – as used in k-means – is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by eagerly performing additional swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster initialization strategies, because (i) the classic (“BUILD”) initialization now becomes the bottleneck, and (ii) our swap is fast enough to compensate for worse starting conditions. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications. While we do not study the parallelization of our approach in this work, it can easily be combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly important. In experiments on real data with k=100,200, we observed a 458× respectively 1191× speedup compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger data sets, and in particular to higher k.},

A non-hierarchial clustering of 1000 mb isobaric trajectories, using squared Euclidean distance as a similarity measure, leads to the identification of a finite number of distinct synoptic patterns. Typical airbore and aqueous pollutant concentrations associated with each of these patterns may then be established. By considering 3-day air trajectories in this study, the "history" of an air parcel is captured in an improved manner, when compared with attempts to use individual day weather "types" to characterize meterological situations. {\textcopyright} 1992.},
